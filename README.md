# Way Out - Ludum Dare 41

This is an example of a BASIC VR conversion made as a fork of the original LD41 project "Way Out" which was made open source.

It is PCVR ONLY.

If you play on an oculus device, only use the Oculus OpenXR runtime, not the SteamVR runtime, as it is a dramatic difference in FPS.

VR Camera is enabled, basic motion controls where the gun shoots from your chosen hand is enabled.  However, I left the original gun / arms model and animations
intact rather than using new "VR Hands."

I am unable to test whether multiplayer works in VR since I don't have two PCVR compatible PCs.  My guess is it will not but you can try, and if you are able to test,
feel free to submit code fixes if you get multiplayer working.

Thanks very much to the original creators for open sourcing their project to make this attempt possible.

VR controls are described in the main menu.

This conversion uses the Godot OpenXR asset and Godot XR Tools asset found on the asset library (master version current as of November 2022) and Godot 3.5.1.
